I am a Senior Undergrad at [R V College of Engineering, Bengaluru, India](http://rvce.edu.in). I am interested in the research areas of machine learning (deep learning), particularly as applied to computer vision and speech, and want to explore their applications in increasing human potential by augmenting in our tasks. Other areas of interest include Image and Signal Processing, Embedded systems and Computational Sustainibility.

I am looking for research oppurtunities in machine learning for June 2018 onwards.
