### About Me

I am Yifan Cai, a fifth-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Linh Thi Xuan Phan](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~linhphan/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I got my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020. 

My projects mainly focus on achieving **safety, security, and privacy** in resource-constrained systems, including traditional distributed systems and real-time cyber-physical systems (CPS). I am also interested in exploring more security problems on the behaviors of systems that interact with humans and the physical world, including but not limited to CPS/embedded security, web security, and usable security in the future.

**I am looking for postdoc opportunities**. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my work!

### Experience

I worked as an intern at Roblox research in the summer of 2024, on improving the scalability of real-time gaming experiences. 

In 2020 and 2023, I interned twice at Alibaba Cloud with Dr. [Wenchao Zhou](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~wzhou/), Dr. [Sheng Wang](https://wangsheng1001.github.io/), and Dr. [Sha Mo](https://desert0616.github.io/) on the secure data access and processing in a memory-constrained environment. 

During undergraduate, I worked as a research intern at Penn advised by Prof. [Vincent Liu](https://vincen.tl) in 2019 on discovering the impact of resource disaggregation on database systems; with Prof. [Xianglei Huang](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/huang-xianglei/) at UMich in the summer of 2018 on applying ML to solar energy forecasting; and with Prof. [Jianping He](https://iwin-fins.com/) at SJTU on consensus protocols in distributed systems.
