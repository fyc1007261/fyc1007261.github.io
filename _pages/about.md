### About Me

I am Yifan Cai, a fourth-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Linh Thi Xuan Phan](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~linhphan/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I got my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020. My research interest is in various aspects of systems, including performance, security, and reliability.

I am working as a research intern at Roblox research in the summer of 2024, on improving the scalability of gaming experiences. 

In 2020 and 2023, I worked as an intern (twice) in the database and storage lab @ Alibaba Cloud with Dr. [Wenchao Zhou](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~wzhou/), Dr. [Sheng Wang](https://wangsheng1001.github.io/), and Dr. [Sha Mo](https://desert0616.github.io/). We focused on the security aspects of cloud computing.

Before that, I was a research intern at Penn advised by Prof. [Vincent Liu](https://vincen.tl) in 2019. We worked on discovering the impact of resource disaggregation on database systems.

I worked with Prof. [Xianglei Huang](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/huang-xianglei/) in the summer of 2018. We designed an implemented a system that could forecast solar energy based on historical data and other factors such as wind and cloud.

During my undergraduate, I worked with Prof. [Jianping He](https://iwin-fins.com/) on consensus protocols in distributed systems.
