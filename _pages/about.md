### About Me

I am Yifan Cai, a senior undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interest is in operating systems, database and networks. 

I worked with Prof. [Jianping He](https://jianping-he.github.io/) on designing data aggregation protocols in distributed network systems. A paper was published in IEEE CDC 2018. 

From July 2019 to December 2019, I worked with Prof. [Vincent Liu](http://vincen.tl/) at the University of Pennsylvania as a research intern. We focused on designing applications which are able to run efficiently on disaggregated systems. A paper has been accepted by CIDR 2020.

I will be joining the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) in fall, 2020.
