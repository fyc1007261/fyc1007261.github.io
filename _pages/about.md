### About Me

I am Yifan Cai, a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Prof. [Andreas Haeberlen](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ahae/) and Prof. [Linh Thi Xuan Phan](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~linhphan/). I got my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020. My research interest is in operating systems, database and networks. 

I worked with Prof. [Jianping He](https://iwin-fins.com) on designing data aggregation protocols in distributed network systems. A paper was published in IEEE CDC 2018. 

From July 2019 to December 2019, I worked with Prof. [Vincent Liu](http://vincen.tl/) at the University of Pennsylvania as a research intern. We focused on designing applications which are able to run efficiently on disaggregated systems. Papers have been published in CIDR 2020 and VLDB 2020.
