### About Me

I am Yifan Cai, a rising senior undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interest is in distributed systems. I have been working with Prof. [Jianping He](https://jianping-he.github.io/) on designing data aggregation protocols in distributed network systems. A paper was published in IEEE CDC 2018. 

Now I'm working with Prof. [Vincent Liu](http://vincen.tl/) at University of Pennsylvania as a research intern. We are trying to design applications which are able to run efficiently on disaggregated systems.

I am now looking forward to a graduate program.
