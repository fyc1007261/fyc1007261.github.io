### About Me

I am Yifan Cai, a fifth-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Linh Thi Xuan Phan](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~linhphan/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I got my bachelor's degree from the School of Software at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020. 

**I am looking for postdoc opportunities starting Summer/Fall 2026**. 

My projects mainly focus on achieving **safety (timely execution of critical tasks)** and **security** in resource-constrained systems, including traditional distributed systems and real-time cyber-physical systems (CPS). My past and present projects include but are not limited to:
- Ensuring data confidentiality and integrity across memory tiers *(VeriDB and UEM)*
- Byzantine fault-resilient cyber-physical systems *(GeoShield)*
- Scheduling-based side channels in IoT/embedded platforms *(STAMP)*
- Analyzing performance (e.g., deadline violations) in complex systems *(LTA Analysis)*

Here is an overview of my projects. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my work, or check out my [CV](./files/YifanCai.pdf) and [publications](./publications)!

### Experience

I worked as an intern at Roblox research in the summer of 2024, on improving the scalability of real-time gaming experiences. 

In 2020 and 2023, I interned twice at Alibaba Cloud with Dr. [Wenchao Zhou](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~wzhou/), Dr. [Sheng Wang](https://wangsheng1001.github.io/), and Dr. [Sha Mo](https://desert0616.github.io/) on the secure data access and processing in a memory-constrained environment. 

During undergraduate, I worked as a research intern at Penn advised by Prof. [Vincent Liu](https://vincen.tl) in 2019 on discovering the impact of resource disaggregation on database systems; with Prof. [Xianglei Huang](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/huang-xianglei/) at UMich in the summer of 2018 on applying ML to solar energy forecasting; with Prof. [Jianping He](https://iwin-fins.com/) at SJTU on consensus protocols in distributed systems; and with Prof. [Zhaoguo Wang](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/zhaoguo_wang) at SJTU on my thesis on resource disaggregation.
