### About Me

I am Yifan Cai, a rising senior undergraduate student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interest is in distributed systems. I have been working with Prof. Jianping He on designing data aggregation protocols in distributed network systems. A paper was published in IEEE CDC 2018. 

Now I'm working with Prof. Vincent Liu in University of Pennsylvania as a student intern. We are trying to design applications which are able to run efficiently on disaggregated systems.

I am now looking for graduate programs.
