### About Me

I am Yifan Cai, a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Prof. [Andreas Haeberlen](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ahae/) and Prof. [Linh Thi Xuan Phan](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~linhphan/). I got my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020. My research interest is in operating systems, database and networks.
