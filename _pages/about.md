### About Me

I am Yifan Cai, a rising senior undergraduate student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interest is in distributed systems. I have been working with Prof. Jianping He on designing data aggregation protocols in distributed network systems. A paper was published in IEEE CDC 2018. 

I am now looking for graduate programs.
