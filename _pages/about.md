### About Me

I am Yifan Cai, a second-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Andreas Haeberlen]([Andreas Haeberlen (upenn.edu)](https://haeberlen.cis.upenn.edu/))  and Prof. [Linh Thi Xuan Phan]([Linh Thi Xuan Phan's Home Page (upenn.edu)](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~linhphan/)) at the University of Pennsylvania. I got my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020. My research interest is in various aspects of distributed systems.
