### About Me

I am Yifan Cai, a fourth-year Ph.D. student advised by Prof. [Linh Thi Xuan Phan](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~linhphan/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I got my bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020. My research interest is in various aspects of systems, especially on the resource allocation, scheduling, and security for time-sensitive systems. I worked and have been working on projects related to
- Security and reliability for large scale safety-critical systems against Byzantine attacks with worst-case timing guarantees.
- Confidentiality, integrity, and freshness of data for fine-grained accesses in heterogeneous memory systems.
- Investigation of potential privacy vulnerabilities in embedded systems task scheduling mechanisms.
- Analysis for various long-term average properties (e.g., deadline misses) of tasks in a system with shared resources.


I worked as an intern at Roblox research in the summer of 2024, on improving the scalability of gaming experiences. 

In 2020 and 2023, I worked as an intern (twice) at Alibaba Cloud with Dr. [Wenchao Zhou](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~wzhou/), Dr. [Sheng Wang](https://wangsheng1001.github.io/), and Dr. [Sha Mo](https://desert0616.github.io/) on the security aspects of cloud computing.

During undergraduate, I worked as a research intern at Penn advised by Prof. [Vincent Liu](https://vincen.tl) in 2019 on discovering the impact of resource disaggregation on database systems; with Prof. [Xianglei Huang](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/huang-xianglei/) at UMich in the summer of 2018 on applying ML to solar energy forecasting; and with Prof. [Jianping He](https://iwin-fins.com/) at SJTU on consensus protocols in distributed systems.
