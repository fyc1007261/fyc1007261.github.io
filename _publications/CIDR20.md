One recent trend of cloud data center design is resource disaggregation. Instead of having server units with “converged” compute, memory, and storage resources, a disaggregated data center (DDC) has pools of  resources of each type connected via a network. While the systems community has been investigating the research challenges of DDC by designing new OS and network stacks, the implications of DDC for next-generation database systems remain unclear. In this paper, we take a first step towards understanding how DDCs might affect the design of relational databases, discuss the potential advantages and drawbacks in the context of data processing, and outline research challenges in addressing them.
