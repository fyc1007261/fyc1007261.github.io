In a disaggregated data center, processor and memory components are separated and use network to connect. It allows better scalability as data center administrators and easily add, remove or change the hardware. Besides, application will be able to regard the system as a single computer but meanwhile access as much resource as a distributed system. In this way, it will be easier for programmers as they do not have to write code for distributed systems explicitly.



However, as processors and memories use network to communicate, the performance degrades. In this paper, we take a first step towards understanding how disaggregated data centers might affect the design of relational databases, discuss the potential advantages and drawbacks in the context of data processing, and outline research challenges in addressing them.
